## Introduction

A cultural event is celebrated in order to preserve an ancient belief or to depict the emotional status of the common crowd related to a specific culture or religion. India with a population of over 1.2 billion people is the country with second largest population in the world. It is the land where along with six major religions, many other religions are followed by the people. With a cultural history spanning for more than 4500 years, it is the birthplace of prominent religions like Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism along with many more. 
Indian cultural events are popular throughout the world for their aura and cultural beliefs. Their mythological relevance fascinates tourists, journalists, photographers, devotees and many more across the globe. The task to recognize an Indian cultural event just by its still images is a cumbersome challenge not just by computer also by a human eye. The topic includes a large number of classes and a variety of representations, thus authors found it important to propose a model that would focus on identifying the event using still images. Due to a varying cultural diversity, the similar cultural events incorporate similar representation of objects and context. Identifying this problem, the authors have made an attempt to identify significant and distinctive representations of each event.
